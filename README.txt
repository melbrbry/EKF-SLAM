# EKF-SLAM

In this project, we build EKF SLAM using the readings from IMU and a point sensor. The IMU sensor provides directly the predicted robot pose, and we use the point sensor readings to update the robot pose.

## Getting Started

You need to clone the reporistory to your local machine. Run this command in your terminal where you like to clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/melbrbry/EKF-SLAM
```

### Prerequisites

Language used:  
Octave

## Repository Description
The repository has only one branch: the master branch.

## Documentation
In this section, I write a brief description of some of the repository files/folders

**EKF IMU based SLAM**: this folder contains the actual code for EKF SLAM.

**datasets**: this folder contains the dataset gathered from the IMU and the point sensor.

**output**: this folder contains the estimated trajectory of the robot and the estimated pose of the lanmarks.

**tools**: this folder contains some tools to handle the data.
